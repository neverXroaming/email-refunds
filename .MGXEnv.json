Some way to obtain the credentials from the user is needed. The application will review emails in the inboxes to identify any purchases - whether one time charges or recurring. The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application. The front end should also allow the user to understand the status of the refund requests.",

If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests.

Some way to obtain the credentials from the user is needed. The application will review emails in the inboxes to identify any purchases - whether one time charges or recurring. The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application. The front end should also allow the user to understand the status of the refund requests.",

The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application.

The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application.

The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application.

The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application.

The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application.

Based on your situation where you can't access localhost, here are some options:\n\n1. **Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages**: These platforms offer free hosting for static web applications like yours. Since we've already built the application (the `dist` folder is ready), we can deploy it to one of these platforms.\n\n2. **Use a different port**: We could try a different port on your local machine if the issue is port-specific.\n\n3. **Use a tunneling service**: We could use a tool like ngrok to create a temporary public URL that forwards to your local server.\n\nWould you like me to help you deploy to one of these alternatives? Netlify or Vercel would be the most straightforward options for a production-ready deployment of your Email Refund Tracker application.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to the root of your repository\n2. Go to Settings > Pages\n3. Set the source to \"Deploy from a branch\"\n4.

Let me try a more direct approach by deploying your application using our built-in deployment tool.\n\nI've just initiated a deployment of your Email Refund Tracker application.

The 'zip' command wasn't available in the environment, but I've created a compressed tar.gz archive instead, which serves the same purpose.\n\nI've just created a downloadable archive called `email-refund-tracker.tar.gz` in the `/workspace/dashboard` directory containing your complete application. You can download this file and extract it on your local machine.\n\nTo use this file for deployment:\n1. Download the `email-refund-tracker.tar.gz` file\n2. Extract it on your computer (using 7zip, WinRAR, or the built-in archive tools)\n3. Upload the extracted contents (which will be the `dist` folder contents) to your hosting service\n\nFor the simplest deployment experience, I recommend:\n- **Netlify Drop**: Just drag and drop the extracted folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop\n- Your application will be instantly deployed with a public URL\n\nWould you like me to provide instructions for extracting the tar.gz file on your specific operating system?\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

If prompted for a username/password by Netlify (not by the app itself):\n   - Try leaving them blank and clicking submit\n   - Or use \"admin\" as username and leave password blank\n\nFor Netlify site protection, you would need to:\n1. Log into your Netlify dashboard\n2. Select your site\n3. Go to Site settings > Access control\n4. Disable the password protection or set your desired credentials\n\nLet me know if you're still having issues accessing the deployed application, and I can help troubleshoot further.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

Let me help troubleshoot this issue:\n\n### Likely Issues and Solutions\n\n1. **Base Path Issue**: For GitHub Pages, the site is usually deployed to a subdirectory (your-username.github.io/repo-name), so we need to configure the base path in your Vite config.\n\n2. **Let me check your current vite.config.js**. We need to make sure it's set up correctly for GitHub Pages deployment.\n\n3. **Asset Path Issues**: The browser might be trying to load assets from incorrect paths, resulting in a blank page. We'll need to update the asset paths in the build.\n\nAfter I check the config file, I'll recommend the necessary changes to fix the blank page issue. In most cases, adding the correct base path to the Vite config will solve this problem.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

There's a mismatch between the repository name and the base path in the configuration.\n\nLet me help you fix this issue:\n\n1. The base path in vite.config.js needs to match your repository name: \"/email-refunds/\"\n2. Let's rebuild the application with the correct base path\n\nSteps to fix:\n\n1.

If the queued state persists after making these changes, you may need to cancel the stuck workflow runs in GitHub Actions and trigger a new deployment.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

Fixed the GitHub Actions workflow file:\n   - Added explicit permissions for writing content\n   - Updated to use pnpm instead of npm (matching your project's package manager)\n   - Added proper pnpm setup step\n\nThe fresh build files have been packaged in `/workspace/dashboard/email-refunds-fresh.tar.gz` which you can download and import into your new GitHub repository.\n\nTo use these files in a new repository:\n1. Create a new repository named \"email-refunds\" on GitHub\n2. Extract the tar.gz file locally\n3. Push the contents to your new repository\n4. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings, setting the source to GitHub Actions\n\nThis should ensure all files are properly cross-referenced with the correct base path matching your repository name.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application.

In PieChart.jsx - It was importing a non-existent `pieChartData` but should have been using `refundStatusData` from mockData.js\n   - Fixed by updating the import and all references to use refundStatusData\n\n2. In LineChart.jsx - It was importing a non-existent `lineChartData` but should have been using `refundTimelineData` \n   - Fixed by updating the import and the data reference\n   - Also updated the Line components to use the correct dataKeys: \"requests\", \"approved\", and \"denied\" which are available in refundTimelineData\n\nThe build now completes successfully without any errors.

Based on your situation where you can't access localhost, here are some options:\n\n1. **Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages**: These platforms offer free hosting for static web applications like yours. Since we've already built the application (the `dist` folder is ready), we can deploy it to one of these platforms.\n\n2. **Use a different port**: We could try a different port on your local machine if the issue is port-specific.\n\n3. **Use a tunneling service**: We could use a tool like ngrok to create a temporary public URL that forwards to your local server.\n\nWould you like me to help you deploy to one of these alternatives? Netlify or Vercel would be the most straightforward options for a production-ready deployment of your Email Refund Tracker application.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

Now that your GitHub repository and workflow are set up, here's how to deploy your application:\n\n1. **Push your code to the repository**: \n   - Since we can't push directly from this environment, you'll need to download these files:\n     - The entire `dist` folder (contains the built application)\n     - The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` workflow file\n\n2. **Upload to GitHub**:\n   - Push all files to your repository's main branch\n   - Make sure the `.github/workflows` directory is at the root of your repository\n\n3. **The workflow will automatically run** when you push to the main branch, which will:\n   - Build your application\n   - Deploy it to GitHub Pages\n\n4. **Monitor the deployment**:\n   - Go to your repository on GitHub\n   - Click on the \"Actions\" tab to see the workflow run\n   - Once completed successfully, your app will be live at: https://neverxroaming.github.io/email-refund-tracker/\n\nIf you prefer to deploy manually instead of using GitHub Actions:\n1. Upload the contents of the `dist` folder to the root of your repository\n2. Go to Settings > Pages\n3. Set the source to \"Deploy from a branch\"\n4. Select \"main\" branch and \"/\" (root) folder\n\nWould you like me to help with any specific part of this deployment process?\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

You can download this file and extract it on your local machine.\n\nTo use this file for deployment:\n1. Download the `email-refund-tracker.tar.gz` file\n2. Extract it on your computer (using 7zip, WinRAR, or the built-in archive tools)\n3. Upload the extracted contents (which will be the `dist` folder contents) to your hosting service\n\nFor the simplest deployment experience, I recommend:\n- **Netlify Drop**: Just drag and drop the extracted folder to https://app.netlify.com/drop\n- Your application will be instantly deployed with a public URL\n\nWould you like me to provide instructions for extracting the tar.gz file on your specific operating system?\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

The Netlify deployment is asking for a password likely because:\n\n1. The application is using some form of authentication that was built into the dashboard template, or\n2. Netlify might have applied site protection (sometimes done automatically for new deployments)\n\nLet me check the application files to see if there's any authentication code that might be causing this. In the meantime, you can try:\n\n1. If prompted for a username/password by Netlify (not by the app itself):\n   - Try leaving them blank and clicking submit\n   - Or use \"admin\" as username and leave password blank\n\nFor Netlify site protection, you would need to:\n1. Log into your Netlify dashboard\n2. Select your site\n3. Go to Site settings > Access control\n4. Disable the password protection or set your desired credentials\n\nLet me know if you're still having issues accessing the deployed application, and I can help troubleshoot further.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

Let me help troubleshoot this issue:\n\n### Likely Issues and Solutions\n\n1. **Base Path Issue**: For GitHub Pages, the site is usually deployed to a subdirectory (your-username.github.io/repo-name), so we need to configure the base path in your Vite config.\n\n2. **Let me check your current vite.config.js**. We need to make sure it's set up correctly for GitHub Pages deployment.\n\n3. **Asset Path Issues**: The browser might be trying to load assets from incorrect paths, resulting in a blank page. We'll need to update the asset paths in the build.\n\nAfter I check the config file, I'll recommend the necessary changes to fix the blank page issue. In most cases, adding the correct base path to the Vite config will solve this problem.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

Your GitHub Pages repository is named \"email-refunds\" but our Vite configuration has base path set to \"/email-refund-tracker/\". There's a mismatch between the repository name and the base path in the configuration.\n\nLet me help you fix this issue:\n\n1. The base path in vite.config.js needs to match your repository name: \"/email-refunds/\"\n2. Let's rebuild the application with the correct base path\n\nSteps to fix:\n\n1. Update vite.config.js to use base: '/email-refunds/'\n2. Rebuild the application\n3. Deploy the updated build to GitHub Pages\n\nWould you like me to make these changes and rebuild the application for you?

Your GitHub Pages repository is named \"email-refunds\" but our Vite configuration has base path set to \"/email-refund-tracker/\". There's a mismatch between the repository name and the base path in the configuration.\n\nLet me help you fix this issue:\n\n1. The base path in vite.config.js needs to match your repository name: \"/email-refunds/\"\n2. Let's rebuild the application with the correct base path\n\nSteps to fix:\n\n1. Update vite.config.js to use base: '/email-refunds/'\n2. Rebuild the application\n3. Deploy the updated build to GitHub Pages\n\nWould you like me to make these changes and rebuild the application for you? This should resolve the blank page issue you're experiencing at https://neverxroaming.github.io/email-refunds/.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

If the queued state persists after making these changes, you may need to cancel the stuck workflow runs in GitHub Actions and trigger a new deployment.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

            "instruction": "\nYou are a world-class engineer, your goal is to write google-style, elegant, modular, readable, maintainable, fully functional, and ready-for-production code.\nYou have been tasked with developing a web app or game.\nUnless the user or a system design specifies, or an existing repo is provided, you should use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template. For website development, the default tech stack is the Shadcn-ui template with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript. The template helps you get started, see the Template section for more information.\n0. Principles\n - Outline all features to develop based on the user requirements. If the requirements are not clear about the features, propose your own version, which, if completed, should fulfill the requirements precisely but not overly.\n - During your development, ensure NO omission NOR surplus of your listed features. NO MORE, NO LESS. This applies to the first development and all incremental requirements/emerging issues.\n - DON'T make improvements without user's consent. End current round of development IMMEDIATELY if you have completed all listed features.\n - If you encounter any issues related to the listed features, fix them directly. Your fix should take minimum steps. When you complete your fix, run `pmpn run lint` for a final check. If the check passes, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to ask the user to test on your fix outcome IMMEDIATELY. You should STOP fixing without user's feedback.\n - If you cannot solve the encountered issues with reasonable attempts, you should ask human immediately for help.\n1. Preparation\n - When provided a system design, read it first with Editor.read in a single response without any other commands. After reading, clearly indicate what files are instructed by the system design, then adhere to the design in your implementation. You may skip this step if no system design is provided.\n - For ANY development task (new project or incremental development) requiring user authentication or data storage, read the Backend section first (MANDATORY BEFORE ANY CODE IMPLEMENTATION OR MODIFICATION).\n - Start by acknowledging the user requirements with RoleZero.reply_to_human and use FrontendEngineer.search_template to search for a template for the project. Output both commands in one response.\n2. When creating new code files or rewriting code files, you should write multiple files. Use Editor.write multiple times based on your system design.\n3. Write out every code detail, DON'T leave TODO or PLACEHOLDER.\n4. Editor is used to edit a small part of a file. You may edit multiple files in one response, but each file is allowed ONLY one operation. DON'T include the row number in the code generated or in the string your want to replace, they are there just for you to understand the position.\n5. When using Editor.edit_file_by_replace, be mindful of white spaces and line breaks!\n6. After finishing the React/Vue/Shadcn-ui project, run `pnpm i && pnpm run lint` to install dependencies and check for potential issues. Perform this operation every time you complete your development (i.e., for the first user requirment and every incremental requirement that follows). If you encounter any issues, fix them before proceeding.\n8. DON'T run or test non-React/Vue/Shadcn-ui projects (such as Python, Java, or Go) yourself. Users should be responsible for running these projects on their own. This step is CRUCIAL for the project to be set up correctly.\n9. Use correct file paths, mind any cd command, for the current directory will change after executing the cd command and applies to all commands after it.\n10. Regarding personal card development: if no additional user information has been provided, you should directly deploy the retrieved template without any modifications.\n11. Check project structure and read necessary files when provided with a repo that you have no information for.\n12. When the developed project needs to obtain images, do not fetch them in advance.\n14. For data dashboard requirements, use the streamlit template. To ensure the project runs correctly, when the user provides data, first view a small portion of the data, and then design the data dashboard based on the data and user requirements.\n15. For Streamlit projects, you must enable the debug option during deployment to ensure the project runs correctly. Use `streamlit run your_script.py` to run the project and don't assign a port.\n16. For projects requiring user-provided data:\n - If Data Analyst has provided JSON/other files, first use Editor.read to understand the key-value structure, then copy to the public directory with appropriate subfolders (e.g., `public/data/some_data.json`). Use relative path in the code. Never rewrite data files.\n - If no JSON is provided, read using Editor.read, then process the raw data using code, and format it in a way that's optimal for frontend display. DO NOT write data yourself.\n - If there are Markdown files, you should copy them to workspace directory and then use it directly. \n - If there are static files (images, audios, videos, 3D models) when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template, you MUST copy them to public/assets directory with appropriate subfolders and replace file path relative to public directory.\n17. Always update the web title in index.html when using React/Vue/Shadcn-ui template.\n18. Regarding previewing the project:\n - For projects from React/Vue/Shadcn-ui/Slidev/Remotion/html template, you don't need run dev or preview the project for it is already running. Simply end after you pass the lint check.\n - Pay attention to the chat history. If the user has already previewed the project, don't preview it again.\n - Otherwise, use Terminal to launch a service if applicable. After you successfully launch a service, solidify the required commands with Previewer.preview_project. This tells the user use these commands to put the project into preview. Don't preview the project again if it has been previewed successfully.\n\n## Template\n\n### dashboard Template Intro\n1. A React-based data visualization dashboard with Recharts integration. Features multiple chart components (line, area, bar, pie, radar, gauge, treemap, bubble), responsive layout with Tailwind CSS, and mock data for immediate demonstration. Ideal for personal portfolios, data analysis showcases, and dashboard prototypes.\n2. The template is at /workspace/dashboard.\n3. The following files are required to be known: index.html, src/main.jsx, src/App.jsx, src/index.css, vite.config.js\n4. The following fields could be modified: \n5. The template is written in JavaScript.\n6. The template is based on React.\n\n### Project Structure\n.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 eslint.config.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 index.html\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 package.json\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pnpm-lock.yaml\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 postcss.config.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 App.jsx\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 components\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Dashboard.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Header.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 Sidebar.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 StatsCard.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 charts\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 AreaChart.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 BarChart.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 BubbleChart.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 GaugeChart.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 LineChart.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 PieChart.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502       \u251c\u2500\u2500 RadarChart.jsx\n\u2502   \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 TreeMap.jsx\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 data\n\u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 mockData.js\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 index.css\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.jsx\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tailwind.config.js\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 template_config.json\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 vite.config.js\n\n4 directories, 25 files\n\n\n### File Content\n<File index.html>\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\" />\n  <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\" />\n  <title>Analytics Dashboard</title>\n</head>\n\n<body>\n  <div id=\"root\"></div>\n  <script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.jsx\"></script>\n</body>\n\n</html>\n\n</File>\n<File src/main.jsx>\nimport { StrictMode } from 'react'\nimport { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'\nimport App from './App.jsx'\nimport './index.css'\n\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(\n  <StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </StrictMode>,\n)\n\n</File>\n<File src/App.jsx>\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Header from './components/Header';\nimport Sidebar from './components/Sidebar';\nimport Dashboard from './components/Dashboard';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"flex flex-col min-h-screen bg-gray-50\">\n      <Header />\n      <div className=\"flex flex-1\">\n        <Sidebar />\n        <main className=\"flex-1 p-6 overflow-auto\">\n          <Dashboard />\n        </main>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n</File>\n<File src/index.css>\n@tailwind base;\n@tailwind components;\n@tailwind utilities;\n\n::-webkit-scrollbar {\n  width: 5px;\n  height: 5px;\n}\n\n::-webkit-scrollbar-track {\n  background-color: transparent;\n}\n\n::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {\n  border-radius: 25px;\n  transition: all 0.3s;\n  background-color: rgba(106, 115, 125, 0.2);\n  &:hover {\n    background-color: rgba(106, 115, 125, 0.27);\n  }\n}\n\n::-webkit-scrollbar-corner {\n  display: none;\n}\n\n</File>\n<File vite.config.js>\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport { viteSourceLocator } from \"@metagptx/vite-plugin-source-locator\";\n\n// https://vitejs.dev/config/\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [viteSourceLocator({\n    prefix: \"mgx\",\n  }), react()],\n})\n\n</File>\n\n\n\n## Backend\nSupabase is not enabled\n",

Updated the base path in `vite.config.js` from `/email-refund-tracker/` to `/email-refunds/` to match your repository name\n2. Fixed the GitHub Actions workflow file:\n   - Added explicit permissions for writing content\n   - Updated to use pnpm instead of npm (matching your project's package manager)\n   - Added proper pnpm setup step\n\nThe fresh build files have been packaged in `/workspace/dashboard/email-refunds-fresh.tar.gz` which you can download and import into your new GitHub repository.\n\nTo use these files in a new repository:\n1. Create a new repository named \"email-refunds\" on GitHub\n2. Extract the tar.gz file locally\n3. Push the contents to your new repository\n4. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings, setting the source to GitHub Actions\n\nThis should ensure all files are properly cross-referenced with the correct base path matching your repository name.\n</content>\n</RoleZero.reply_to_human>\n\n<end></end>",

Created new components:\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/EmailConnectionModal.jsx` - Modal for connecting email accounts\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/StatsCard.jsx` - Component for displaying refund statistics\n\n2. Updated existing components:\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/App.jsx` - Added state management for email connections\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated to display connected accounts\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` - Added email connection trigger\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/index.html` - Updated title to \"Email Refund Tracker\"\n\n3. Verified code quality with linting (passed with no issues)\n\n## Do you see the new functionality in the dashboard? Would you like me to:\n\n1. Implement the functionality to disconnect an email account?\n2. Create email filtering options in the EmailList component?\n3. Implement a confirmation dialog for critical actions like account disconnection?",

The application will have the ability to read emails in one or more inboxes specified by the user. Some way to obtain the credentials from the user is needed. The application will review emails in the inboxes to identify any purchases - whether one time charges or recurring. The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application. The front end should also allow the user to understand the status of the refund requests.",

The program will compile a list of all of these purchases and present them to the user for them to decide whether they wish to obtain a refund for the purchase. If the user elects to obtain a refund, the application will identify how to do so (instructions should be in the emails or obtainable via the sales pages from which the products were purchased). The application will compose and send emails to the vendors making refund requests with all information required by the vendor. The application will keep track of whether refunds have been requested. The application will also continue to review ongoing email correspondence related to these refund requests. Once a disposition is obtained, the application will log the disposition in the previously assembled list. \n\nA simple front end should be created for the user to provide any information required by the application.

            "instruction": "\nBased on the context, write a plan or modify an existing plan to achieve the goal. A plan consists of one to 3 tasks.\nIf plan is created, you should track the progress and update the plan accordingly, such as Plan.finish_current_task, Plan.append_task, Plan.reset_task, Plan.replace_task, etc.\nWhen presented a current task, tackle the task using the available commands.\nPay close attention to new user message, review the conversation history, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to respond to new user requirement.\nNote:\n1. If you keeping encountering errors, unexpected situation, or you are not sure of proceeding, use RoleZero.ask_human to ask for help.\n2. Carefully review your progress at the current task, if your actions so far has not fulfilled the task instruction, you should continue with current task. Otherwise, finish current task by Plan.finish_current_task explicitly.\n3. Each time you finish a task, use RoleZero.reply_to_human to report your progress.\n4. Don't forget to append task first when all existing tasks are finished and new tasks are required.\n5. Avoid repeating tasks you have already completed. And end loop when all requirements are met.\n\n6. Carefully consider how you handle web tasks:\n - Use SearchEnhancedQA for general information searching, i.e. querying search engines, such as googling news, weather, wiki, etc. Usually, no link is provided.\n - Use Browser for reading, navigating, or in-domain searching within a specific web, such as reading a blog, searching products from a given e-commerce web link, or interacting with a web app.\n - Use DataAnalyst.write_and_execute_code for web scraping, such as gathering batch data or info from a provided link.\n - Write code to view the HTML content rather than using the Browser tool.\n - Make sure the command_name are certainly in Available Commands when you use the Browser tool.\n7. When you are making plan. It is highly recommend to plan and append all the tasks in first response once time, except for 7.1.\n7.1. When the requirement is inquiring about a pdf, docx, md, or txt document, read the document first through either Editor.read WITHOUT a plan. After reading the document, use RoleZero.reply_to_human if the requirement can be answered straightaway, otherwise, make a plan if further calculation is needed.\n8. If the requirement explicitly mentions generating/creating/writing/producing a document/report/summary, you should use Editor.write to output the document.\n9. Don't finish_current_task multiple times for the same task.\n10. Finish current task timely, such as when the code is written and executed successfully.\n11. When using the command 'end', add the command 'finish_current_task' before it.\n12. When asked to convert user provided data for web display, convert them to JSON format based on user requirement, and store them ALL and totally. DO NOT use ellipsis (...) or only part of the data.\n13. If you have trouble processing docx or pdf documents, try use some tools (like python-docx, PyPDF2 etc.). Never generate data by yourself. For Word documents, carefully preserve all formatting elements including structure, styling, and embedded content, sophisticated design is needed.\n",

Updated existing components:\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/App.jsx` - Added state management for email connections\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/Dashboard.jsx` - Updated to display connected accounts\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/Sidebar.jsx` - Added email connection trigger\n   - `/workspace/dashboard/index.html` - Updated title to \"Email Refund Tracker\"\n\n3. Verified code quality with linting (passed with no issues)\n\n## Do you see the new functionality in the dashboard? Would you like me to:\n\n1. Implement the functionality to disconnect an email account?\n2. Create email filtering options in the EmailList component?\n3. Implement a confirmation dialog for critical actions like account disconnection?",

Improved UI for refund request management\n\n## Deliverables\n\n- `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/EmailList.jsx`: Enhanced to support line items and correlated emails\n- `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/RefundRequestModal.jsx`: Updated to handle specific line item refund requests\n- `/workspace/dashboard/src/components/Dashboard.jsx`: Modified to calculate statistics based on line items\n- `/workspace/dashboard/src/App.jsx`: Updated to manage multiple email accounts\n\nAll changes passed lint checks without errors.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nDo you see the updated features in the application? I'd be happy to help with any further requests:\n\n1. Would you like to build and run the application to test the new features?\n2. Should I add a feature to export refund data to CSV or other formats?\n3. Would you like to enhance the authentication system for better security?",
